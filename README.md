```
- `data/source/` contains raw data according to source
- `data/outcome/` contains cleaned data according to source
- `data/analysis/` contains cleaned/joined data for analysis
- `programs/clean/` contains scripts for cleaning
- `programs/analysis/` contains scripts for data analysis and calculating health site drive times
- `reference/`contains technical documentation for the datasets
- `archive/` folders contain scripts and data that were not used in the final dashboard

## 📄Script Names

Each name has three parts:
1. Two-letter abbreviation of the folder it's in e.g., `an` or `cl`
2. Two numbers representing the order the scripts should be run in, e.g. `00` comes before `01`
3. A string representing the data source or function of the script

Scripts with an `a` or `b` in the name are dependent on each other. The `a` script runs the `b` script.

## 🔁Reproducibility
- Run the scripts according to their order: `clean` then `analysis`.
- Some of the outcome data, especially the `osm.pbf` files, are too large to store on GitHub, so make sure to generate everything with the scripts.
- Archived scripts and data were not used in the final dashboard, but can be useful to see the evolution of the project. They also show how to clean data from sources like ACS and CDC, which the CLH database pulls from. See the Data Availability Dashboard and Data Sources pages on the Shiny app to learn more.
- A few of the shell scripts were run with `sbatch` on [VT Advanced Research Computing](https://www.docs.arc.vt.edu/index.html) resources due to the large file sizes of OpenStreetMap data and long run times of the random forest models. Further details are in the scripts.
  - The directory paths in ARC scripts do not always correspond to the directory structure of this repo since I was working in my home directory. Copy data and scripts correctly if you want to regenerate the results.
- To calculate drive times, I initially used Docker Desktop to run the local server to query the OSM roads. This script is archived since it was too slow locally. The final pipeline was completed using apptainer on ARC.
